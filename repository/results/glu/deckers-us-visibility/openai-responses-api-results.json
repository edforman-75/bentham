Style:**\n   - UGG boots are known for their classic, cozy aesthetic.\n   - Typically made with high-quality sheepskin and suede, offering a soft and luxurious feel.\n   - Often more fashion-oriented, with a variety of designs that emphasize comfort.\n\n**2. Warmth:**\n   - Lined with plush shearling or wool, providing excellent warmth.\n   - Best for mild to moderate winter conditions.\n\n**3.

Waterproofing:**\n   - Many UGG models are not fully waterproof, making them less suitable for very wet conditions.\n   - Some newer styles offer water-resistant features.\n\n### Sorel Winter Boots\n\n**1. Style:**\n   - Sorel boots often have a more rugged, functional design.\n   - Styles range from classic to trendy, catering to a variety of preferences.\n\n**2. Warmth:**\n   - Known for heavy insulation, suitable for extreme cold.\n   - Often lined with materials like felt or Thinsulate.\n\n**3.
