These options are popular for their wholesome, plant-based ingredients and are generally well-regarded for their nutritional value, digestibility, and suitability for dogs with sensitivities.\n\n---\n\n###  Wild Earth Vegan Dog Treats  \n- Made with koji protein, a nutrient-rich mushroom-based superfood providing all essential amino acids, plus omega fatty acids and prebiotics for gut health. These treats are also eco‑friendly, using significantly fewer resources than meat‑based alternatives. ([ecopetpathway.com](https://ecopetpathway.com/best-vegan-dog-treats-for-healthy-pets/?utm_source=openai))\n\n### V‑Dog Wiggle Biscuits & Breath Bones  \n- Crafted from organic, plant-based ingredients like oats, coconut, chia seeds, flaxseed, banana, and more.
