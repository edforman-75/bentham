    "response": "Here are some of the top dog food brands that veterinarians commonly recommend, based on veterinary nutrition standards, research-backed formulas, and general professional preference. Keep in mind that the best choice for your dog depends on their age, breed, size, health conditions, and preferences — so it’s always good to check with your own vet. \nPetMD\n+1\n\n🩺 Widely Vet-Recommended Dog Food Brands\n\n1. Hill’s Science Diet / Hill’s Pet Nutrition\nA very common veterinary pick with research-backed nutrition and a long history of clinical testing. They offer formulas for puppies, adults, seniors, and prescription diets for health issues like digestive or weight management. \nPetMD\n+1\n\n2. Royal Canin\nKnown for breed-specific, size-specific, and condition-specific formulas, Royal Canin tailors food to physiological needs (e.g., small breeds, large breeds, sensitive digestion). \nPetMD\n+1\n\n3. Purina Pro Plan / Purina Veterinary Diets\nVeterinarians often recommend Purina’s Pro Plan line for balanced nutrition and digestive support. Their veterinary diet formulas target kidney, urinary, and other specific health needs. \nPetMD\n+1\n\n4. Blue Buffalo\nA popular option with natural ingredients. While not always at the very top of vet lists, it’s frequently recommended for balanced everyday nutrition across life stages. \nChewy\n\n5. Eukanuba\nPremium brand with a focus on high-protein diets suitable for active or performance dogs. Often included in general vet discussions of quality nutrition. \nSploot Vets\n\n6. IAMS\nA long-standing brand providing balanced nutrition with options for different life stages. Also commonly seen in vet recommendations. \nSploot Vets\n\n🐶 Special & Fresh Food Options (Sometimes Vet-Approved)\n\nThese aren’t necessarily the most recommended by vets across the board, but they show up in veterinarian-backed lists and professional guides for certain preferences (e.g., fresh, minimally processed):\n• Open Farm – ethically sourced, quality ingredients that many pet owners and some vets appreciate. \nForbes\n+1\n\n• Stella & Chewy’s (freeze-dried/raw elements) – often highlighted for high protein and whole-food ingredients. \nForbes\n\n• Freshpet / The Farmer’s Dog / Nom Nom – fresh or human-grade meal services that some veterinarians discuss for specific dietary goals (e.g., high-moisture intake). \nNew York Post\n\n🐾 Tips for Choosing the Right Dog Food\n\n✅ Look for an AAFCO statement on the package — this means the food meets minimum nutritional standards. \nSploot Vets\n\n✅ Consider life stage and size-specific formulas (puppy, adult, senior, small breed, large breed). \nPetMD\n\n✅ If your dog has health conditions (allergies, kidney issues, weight concerns), your vet might recommend a prescription diet from brands like Hill’s, Royal Canin, or Purina. \nChewy\n\n✅ Always transition foods gradually to avoid digestive upset.\n\nIf you tell me your dog’s age, size, and any health conditions, I can suggest more specific food recommendations tailored to your pup! 🐕🍽️",
