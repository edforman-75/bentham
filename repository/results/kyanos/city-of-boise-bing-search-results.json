The city also has private options like Bishop Kelly High School and Riverstone International School. \n1\nNeighborhoods: Boise has a variety of neighborhoods, each with its own vibe and perks. Some neighborhoods are historic, with tree-lined streets and close proximity to parks, while others offer suburban comfort with easy access to downtown. \n1\nOutdoor Activities: Boise is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts, with the Boise River Greenbelt offering over 25 miles of scenic paths for biking, walking, or running. The city also provides skiing and snowboarding opportunities in nearby mountains and Bogus Basin for skiing and snowboarding. \n1\nJob Market: Boise has a booming job market with major employers in technology, healthcare, construction, and education.
