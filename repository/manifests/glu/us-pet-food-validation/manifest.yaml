  This study tests whether the patterns observed in the HUFT India study
  generalize to the US market:
  - ChatGPT Web adds brand mentions vs OpenAI API
  - Google AI Overview reduces brand mentions vs Gemini API

  If patterns hold: our "Foundation Model Visibility" positioning is valid
  If patterns differ: we need to qualify positioning by geography/category

# Surfaces to compare

# Success criteria for validation
validation:
  hypotheses:
    - name: "ChatGPT Web adds visibility"
      expected: "ChatGPT Web should have more brand mentions than OpenAI API"
      measurement: "Sum of brand mentions across all queries"

    - name: "Google AI Overview is conservative"
      expected: "Google AI Overview should have fewer brand mentions than Gemini API"
      measurement: "Sum of brand mentions across all queries"

    - name: "US brands boosted in US"
      expected: "US brands (Blue Buffalo, Purina, etc.) should be prominent"
      measurement: "Brand mention rankings"
