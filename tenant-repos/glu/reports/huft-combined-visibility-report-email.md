**Subject:** HUFT AI Visibility Study - Google & OpenAI Surfaces Compared

---

Hi Ranjan,

We've completed comprehensive AI visibility studies across both Google and OpenAI surfaces. The combined analysis covers **480 total queries** across **24 surface configurations**, providing a complete picture of HUFT's presence in AI-powered product discovery.

## The Core Findings

### 1. HUFT Visibility Varies Dramatically by Platform and Surface

| Platform | Surface | India Location | US Location |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **ChatGPT Web** | Consumer interface | **75%** | 31-50% |
| **Google AI Overview** | Search integration | **25-40%** | 15% |
| **Google Organic** | Traditional SEO | **70-85%** | 10-75% |
| **Gemini API** | Google's AI API | **75-85%** | 15% |
| **OpenAI Chat API** | Developer API | **15-35%** | 10% |

### 2. Location + Query Localization = Maximum Visibility

The "in India" suffix consistently improves HUFT visibility across both platforms:

| Configuration | HUFT in AI Overview | HUFT in Response |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| India IP + Original | 25% | 70% |
| India IP + "in India" | **40%** | **90%** |
| US IP + Original | 15% | 15% |
| US IP + "in India" | 60% | **80%** |

### 3. Google AI Overviews: The New Battleground

**Key Insight:** HUFT appears in only **11.3% of AI Overviews** overall, but competitors like Royal Canin, Pedigree, and Drools appear in **60%+ of AI Overviews** for dog food queries.

When HUFT does appear in AI Overviews, it's typically for:
- Dog treats and accessories queries
- Queries with explicit India context
- Brand-specific searches

HUFT is **notably absent** from AI Overviews for:
- "Best dog food brands" (generic queries)
- "Vet-recommended dog food"
- "High-protein dog food"

### 4. API vs Consumer Surface Gap Persists

Both Google and OpenAI show the same pattern:

| Platform | Consumer Surface | API Surface | Gap |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----|
| OpenAI | 75% (ChatGPT Web) | 15% (Chat API) | **60%** |
| Google | 40% (AI Overview) | 75% (Gemini API w/suffix) | Inverted |

**Interesting finding:** Google's Gemini API actually performs *better* than AI Overviews for HUFT visibility when queries include "in India"—the opposite of OpenAI's pattern.

## Platform-Specific Insights

### Google Surfaces (240 queries across 12 studies)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Queries | 240 |
| HUFT Mentioned (any surface) | 137 (57.1%) |
| HUFT in AI Overview | 27 (11.3%) |
| HUFT in Organic Top 3 | 60 (25.0%) |
| HUFT in Organic Top 10 | 97 (40.4%) |

**Best performing Google configuration:** India IP + "in India" suffix shows HUFT in **90% of queries** (organic or AI Overview combined).

**Brands dominating AI Overviews:** Royal Canin, Pedigree, Drools, Purina, Orijen, Acana, Farmina.

### OpenAI Surfaces (240 queries across 12 studies)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Queries | 240 |
| ChatGPT Web (India IP) | 70-73 mentions (75%) |
| ChatGPT Web (US IP) | 31-50 mentions (40%) |
| Chat API | 3-22 mentions (15%) |
| Web Search API | 1-36 mentions (25%) |

**Key finding:** ChatGPT Web from India IP produces **5x more HUFT mentions** than any API surface. API testing cannot predict consumer experience.

## Strategic Implications

### Vulnerability: AI Overview Gap

HUFT's **11.3% AI Overview presence** vs competitors' **60%+ presence** is a critical gap. As zero-click searches increase (users get answers from AI Overviews without clicking through), HUFT risks losing discovery volume to competitors who appear in these summaries.

### Opportunity: Strong Organic + Query Optimization

HUFT's organic ranking remains strong (40% in top 10). Combined with query localization ("in India"), HUFT achieves high visibility. The strategy should focus on:

1. **AI Overview optimization** - Ensure structured data, authoritative content, and signals that influence AI Overview selection
2. **Defend organic position** - Maintain SEO excellence while competitors optimize for AI surfaces
3. **Leverage localization** - Indian users adding "in India" see HUFT 90% of the time; encourage this behavior

### Cross-Platform Strategy

| Priority | Action | Expected Impact |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **High** | AI Overview optimization (structured data, authority signals) | +30% AI Overview presence |
| **High** | Maintain ChatGPT Web visibility from India | Defend 75% presence |
| **Medium** | Content for vet-recommended, high-protein categories | Fill visibility gaps |
| **Low** | API optimization | Limited consumer impact |

| Google (12 studies) | 240 | $1.61 |
| **Total** | **480** | **$9.29** |

Google studies used SerpAPI ($10/1K searches) which proved far more reliable than browser automation for capturing AI Overviews at scale.
