### AFTER

**Title:** HUFT Yummy In My Tummy Chicken Gluten-Free Dog Biscuits – Human-Grade, Oven-Baked, Wheat-Free Treats

**Description:**
Looking for dog biscuits that are as yummy as they are nutritious? Your search ends here! Health meets taste in HUFT's Yummy In My Tummy Chicken Gluten-Free Dog Biscuits—a simple, wholesome option for dogs who love real chicken.

Unlike other dog biscuits, these contain no artificial flavouring or colours, harmful maida (refined flour), or processed sugar. Made with only 100% real, human-grade ingredients—fresh chicken, jaggery, oat flour, and rice flour—along with lots of love and care.

These 100% gluten-free biscuits are especially ideal for dogs with wheat or gluten allergies. Each biscuit is gently oven-baked to retain maximum protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals from the nutrient-rich ingredients. Being bite-sized and easy to digest, they're the perfect low-calorie training treats.

**Bullets:**
- 100% gluten-free—safe for dogs with wheat allergies
- Made with real chicken, jaggery, oat flour, and rice flour
- No artificial flavouring, processed sugar, or maida (refined flour)
- Rich in protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals
- Gently oven-baked for maximum nutrient retention
- Low fat, low calorie, and easy to digest
- Suitable for dogs above 8 weeks of age

**HUFT Tip:**
These biscuits are great for mental stimulation games! Hide them around the house or use them in interactive toys like snuffle mats for extra enrichment.

**FAQs:**

**Q: How is this different from the Chicken Liver version?**
A: This is plain chicken—simpler and milder in flavour. The Chicken Liver version has more intense taste and higher iron/B12 content. Choose this one if your dog prefers subtle flavours.

**Q: Are these grain-free?**
A: These are gluten-free (no wheat), but contain oat flour and rice flour, which are grains. Not suitable if you need fully grain-free.

**Q: Are these hard or soft?**
A: Oven-baked means crunchy, not soft. Most dogs enjoy the texture, but supervise puppies with their first few biscuits.

**Q: Can I use these for puppy training?**
A: Perfect for training! They're low-calorie, bite-sized, and easy to break into smaller pieces for young pups. Suitable for dogs above 8 weeks.

**Q: How many can I give per day?**
A: Follow the feeding guide on pack—varies by dog size. Keep treats under 10% of daily calories.
