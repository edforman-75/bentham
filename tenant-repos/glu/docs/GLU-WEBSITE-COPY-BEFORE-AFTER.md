# HOMEPAGE

## Hero Headline

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Product discovery is shifting from search to AI answers. Are you showing up? | When customers ask AI what to buy, are you the answer? |

**Why change:** Current is passive and explanatory. Proposed is direct, action-oriented, and uses the "Own The Answer" theme.

---

## Hero Subheadline

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Glu makes Shopify brands visible and trusted inside AI answers. | Glu helps brands get discovered when customers ask for product recommendations. |

**Why change:** "Visible and trusted" is abstract. "Get discovered when customers ask" is concrete and benefit-focused.

---

## Hero Body Text

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| The platform structures store data enabling AI engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity to find and recommend products. The service aims to ensure brands appear when customers query AI about specific product categories. | When someone asks Google "What's the best running shoe for beginners?" or ChatGPT "What moisturizer works for sensitive skin?"—they're not getting a list of links anymore. They're getting an answer. Glu makes sure your products are part of that answer. |

**Why change:** Current is technical and third-person ("The platform," "The service"). Proposed speaks directly to the reader with concrete examples.

---

## Primary CTA

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Join the Pilot | Install Free on Shopify |

**Why change:** "Join the Pilot" creates friction and suggests limited availability. "Install Free on Shopify" is immediate and removes hesitation.

---

## Secondary Text

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Select pilot partnerships open. | Free to start. Optimize your first product in 2 minutes. |

---

# PILOT SIGN-UP PAGE

## Headline

## Body Copy

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Brands joining our pilot this December will start optimizing and learning, while others are still weighing options. That early-mover advantage can make all the difference. Secure your spot today. | 50% of consumers already use AI to shop. The brands that optimize now will be visible wherever customers ask. The brands that wait will be invisible across all of them. Get started in 2 minutes. |

**Why change:** Current is about timing/FOMO. Proposed grounds urgency in market data and emphasizes speed.

---

# FEATURES PAGE

## Main Headline

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Everything you need to get your products seen, trusted, and chosen in AI answers. | Most tools tell you what to fix. We fix it. |

Track your visibility across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. See which competitors show up instead of you. |

|------------------|------------------|
| **Content Generation** | **Content That AI Can Cite** |
| Creates "AI-optimized titles and product descriptions" including FAQ generation and optimized image tags. | Titles that expand your brand and product attributes.

---

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|

---

# ABOUT PAGE

## Hero Headline

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| About Glu | The Answer Economy Is Here |

**Why change:** "About Glu" is generic. Proposed introduces the market context immediately.

---

## Hero Subheadline

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| We're building the AI discovery platform that helps Shopify merchants win in the Answer Economy. | Commerce is moving from search results to AI answers. When customers ask AI, they want trusted recommendations—not a list of links. Glu ensures your brand is present when that trust is built. |

**Why change:** Current is company-focused. Proposed is market-focused and explains the shift.

---

## Mission Statement

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| The platform helps merchants structure store data so AI engines can locate, interpret, and suggest products with direct Shopify integration. | We make brands visible to AI. Then we make them trusted. Then we help them get chosen. |

**Why change:** Current is technical and passive. Proposed is a clear three-step value proposition.

---

## Market Context Section

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|

|------------------|------------------|
| **Partner, Not Vendor** | **Partnership, Not Vendor** |

| **Fix It, Don't Report It** | **Results, Not Reports** |
| (no description shown) | Most tools tell you what's broken. We fix it. When we find a problem with your product data, we don't send you a PDF. We fix it and show you the result. |

# CONTACT PAGE

## Hero Headline

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|

# FAQ SECTION (All Pages)

## Q: What does Glu do?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| (Various versions across pages) | We help brands get discovered when people ask Google, ChatGPT, or other AI systems for product recommendations. We optimize your product and brand content so AI can find, understand, and recommend what you sell. |

---

## Q: What is GEO/AEO?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| AEO differs from SEO by optimizing "how AI systems read, interpret, and represent brands" | GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization. It's like SEO, but for AI systems. SEO optimizes for search rankings—getting your page to appear in Google results. GEO optimizes for AI recommendations—getting your product mentioned when someone asks an AI assistant for advice. |

**Why change:** Current is abstract. Proposed uses the SEO comparison everyone understands.

---

## Q: How is this different from SEO?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| (Unclear in current site) | SEO optimizes for search engine rankings. GEO optimizes for AI recommendations. Different signals, different outputs, different technical approach. You need both, but most tools only do SEO. |

---

## Q: How long until I see results?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Results visible within "4-6 weeks" | You'll start seeing results within days. When customers use web AI platforms—ChatGPT.com, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews—they're getting fresh information. Your optimized content can appear almost immediately. Much faster than SEO, which can take 6-12 months. |

**Why change:** Current understates speed. Proposed sets accurate expectations based on how customers actually search (browser-based AI, not API).

---

## Q: My agency handles SEO. Why do I need you?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| (Not on current site) | Ask your agency: "Across Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and Perplexity, which of our competitors are being recommended for our top 10 purchase-intent queries—and what signals are driving those recommendations versus ours?" If they can show you a competitive matrix with citation sources, structured data gaps, and a prioritized remediation plan, keep them. If they say "we'll look into it," that's the gap we fill. We work with agencies too—we handle the AI visibility layer while they handle traditional search. |

---

## Q: How can I measure ROI?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| (Not on current site) | Referral traffic from web AI platforms—Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT.com, Perplexity—shows in your analytics just like any other source. Return rates drop when customers have better pre-purchase information. Conversion rates improve when visitors arrive with confidence. We focus on browser-based AI because that's what your customers actually use. (API-based testing doesn't reflect real user experience.) We can help you track impact directly—give us your sales and returns data and we'll build a before/after analysis. |

---

## Q: Do I stay in control?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| (Mentioned but not as FAQ) | Yes. Always. We work fast, but nothing changes without your approval. AI does the heavy lifting—you make the decisions. Every change gets your sign-off before it goes live. |

---

## Q: My agency supports multiple stores. Can we partner?

| BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Proposed) |
|------------------|------------------|
| (Not on current site) | Yes. We partner with agencies to add AI visibility as a service layer for your clients. You keep the relationship, we provide the expertise and execution. [Contact us about partnership →] |
