## Q&A: COMMON OBJECTIONS

### How are you different from what I get from my SEO vendor?

Two fundamental differences:

- **Scope.** SEO optimizes for Google's crawlers—meta tags, page speed, backlinks, keyword density. We optimize for how AI systems understand and represent your brand. That means structured product data, knowledge graph presence, review aggregation, content freshness signals, and cross-platform consistency across Claude, GPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews. Your SEO vendor is optimizing for one search paradigm. We're preparing you for the next one.

- **Execution.** SEO tools generate audit reports. You get a list of what's wrong—then it's your problem to fix. We partner with you to actually implement the fixes: restructuring your product data, enriching your listings, building the content that AI systems need to recommend you confidently. We don't hand you a checklist and walk away.

### How can I measure the ROI from your services?

Sales attribution is notoriously difficult in ecommerce—that hasn't changed. But here's what you can measure:

- **Referral traffic.** When customers reach you through web AI platforms—Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT.com, Perplexity—you'll see that in your analytics just like any other referral source. We focus on browser-based AI because that's what your customers actually use. (API-based testing doesn't reflect real user experience.)

- **Return rate reduction.** Customers who get better pre-purchase information make fewer mistakes. When your product pages contain the answers users are actually asking, buyers know what they're getting. Lower returns, lower support costs.

- **Conversion rate improvement.** Better-informed visitors convert at higher rates. When your product pages contain the answers users are actually asking, buyers arrive with confidence. You should see your visit-to-purchase ratio improve.

We can help you track the impact directly. Give us access to your sales and returns data, and we'll build a before/after analysis tied to the products we optimize.

### My agency handles our SEO. Why do I need you?

Ask your agency: *"Across Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and Perplexity, which of our competitors are being recommended for our top 10 purchase-intent queries—and what signals are driving those recommendations versus ours?"*

If they can show you a competitive matrix with citation sources, structured data gaps, and a prioritized remediation plan, keep them. If they say "we'll look into it," that's the gap we fill.

We work with agencies too—we handle the AI visibility layer while they handle traditional search.

### My digital agency supports many different stores. Is there a way for us to work together to support my clients?

Yes. We partner with agencies to add AI visibility as a service layer for your clients. You keep the relationship, we provide the expertise and execution.
