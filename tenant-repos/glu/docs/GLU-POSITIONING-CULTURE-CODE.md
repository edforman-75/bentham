## THE COMPANY

### What We Do (One Line)

Glu helps brands get discovered when customers ask for product recommendations.

### What We Do (Expanded)

When someone asks Google "What's the best running shoe for beginners?" or ChatGPT "What moisturizer works for sensitive skin?" — they're no longer going to get a list of links. They're going to get an answer.

Glu makes sure your products are part of that answer.

We optimize your product and brand content so AI systems can find, understand, and recommend what you sell. We call this GEO: Generative Engine Optimization.

### The Shift We're Addressing

Google has already changed. Type a product question into google.com today and you won't see a list of ten blue links. You'll see an AI Overview — a synthesized answer that recommends specific products, compares options, and tells you what to buy.

Most people never scroll past it.

The data is stark — and accelerating fast:

- **58%** of all Google searches now end without a single click to any website — up from 25% just five years ago
- When AI Overviews appear, that jumps to **83%** — 8 out of 10 users get their answer and leave
- Organic click-through rates have dropped **61%** on queries with AI Overviews
- Retail keywords triggering AI Overviews increased **206%** in just two months in early 2025
- By mid-2026, analysts project **70%+** of all searches will be zero-click

This isn't a gradual shift. It's happening right now, faster than anyone predicted. Half of consumers already use AI to shop. By 2028, $750 billion in spending will flow through AI discovery channels.

And Google isn't the only player. OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Perplexity, Meta, and X are all competing to capture a share of how people search and discover products. Each is building AI systems that answer questions directly — not with links, but with recommendations.

Regardless of who wins this battle, one thing is certain: AI-driven discovery is the future. The brands that optimize for it now will be visible wherever customers ask. The brands that wait will be invisible across all of them.

Google built its empire on sending traffic to websites. Now it's keeping users inside the search results page, answering their questions directly. The brands that appear in those AI-generated answers get seen. Everyone else gets buried below the fold — or ignored entirely.

This is the biggest shift in how people find products since Google itself. And most brands aren't ready for it.

## VISION

### Where we're headed:

Commerce is moving from search results to AI answers. When customers ask AI, they're not looking for options—they want trusted answers. Glu ensures brands are present when that trust is built.

### Alternative Vision Statements

**Direct / Consequence-focused:**

- If you're not in the answer, you're not in the conversation. And if you're not in the conversation, you don't get the sale.
- In the Answer Economy, there's no second page. You're either recommended or you're invisible.
- When customers ask what to buy, there's only one answer. Be it — or lose the sale to whoever is.

**Aspiration + urgency:**

- Every product search is becoming a product recommendation. The brands in those recommendations win. Everyone else wonders where their traffic went.
- The future of commerce isn't ranking higher. It's being the answer. We make sure you are.

**Simple / punchy:**

- No answer, no sale. We put you in the answer.
- Be the answer — or be invisible.
- When AI recommends, you win. When it doesn't, someone else does.

**Founder-voice (more personal):**

- We believe the brands that show up when customers ask will own the next decade of commerce. The ones that don't will spend it trying to catch up.

## MISSION

### What we do every day:

Build the first Shopify-native platform that structures store data so AI engines can find, understand, and recommend products.

### Simplified alternative:

Close the gap between human-optimized content and AI-readable intelligence.

### Even simpler:

Make brands visible to AI. Make them trusted. Make them get chosen. So they sell more.

## VALUES / CULTURE CODE

### Our Operating System

These aren't aspirational. These are how we actually work — and what our customers tell us matters most.

### 1. Results, Not Reports

Most tools tell you what's broken. We fix it.

Dashboards are easy. Delivery is hard. We chose hard.

**What this means for you:** When we find a problem with your product data, we don't send you a PDF. We fix it and show you the result.

### 2. Speed to Value

Minutes, not months. You'll see your first results fast.

We don't believe in long implementations, endless onboarding, or "give it six months." If it's not working quickly, something's wrong.

**What this means for you:** Optimize your first product in 2 minutes. See measurable results in 4-6 weeks.

### 3. You Stay in Control

We work fast, but nothing happens without your approval.

AI does the heavy lifting. You make the decisions. Every change gets your sign-off before it goes live.

**What this means for you:** Human-in-the-loop, always. Your store, your call.

### 4. Clarity Over Complexity

AI is confusing enough. We don't add to it.

We explain what we do in plain language. We show results you can understand. No jargon unless you ask for it.

**What this means for you:** You'll always know what we did, why we did it, and whether it worked.

### 5. Partnership, Not Vendor

We succeed when you succeed. That's not marketing copy — it's the business model.

This isn't a one-time engagement. We're invested in outcomes, not contracts. Your growth is our growth.

**What this means for you:** We don't disappear after the sale. On an annual commitment, we monitor your AI visibility and report back every month. We check results. We iterate. We stay with you.

### 6. Prove It Works

No trust-us. No black boxes. You see the data.

We track where your products appear in AI answers. We measure the impact. You can verify everything.

**What this means for you:** Measurable ROI you can show your team, your boss, or yourself.

## FOR TALENT (LINKEDIN VERSION)

### Who We Are

Glu is building the infrastructure for how brands get discovered in the age of AI.

When someone asks ChatGPT for a product recommendation, that's not a search—it's a purchase decision happening in real time. We make sure the right products show up in that conversation.

### What We Believe

- **The shift is real.** Half of consumers use AI to shop. This isn't hype—it's happening now.
- **Execution beats analysis.** We ship fixes, not reports.
- **Timing matters.** Early movers in AI discovery will build advantages that compound for years.
- **Partnership over transactions.** We grow when our customers grow.

### Why Join

We're at the intersection of AI, commerce, and a $750 billion market shift. This is the SEO moment of the 2020s—except this time, we're building it from the ground floor.

## Q&A

### What does Glu do?

We help brands get discovered when people ask Google, ChatGPT, or other AI systems for product recommendations. We optimize your product and brand content so AI can find, understand, and recommend what you sell.

### What is GEO?

GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization. It's like SEO, but for AI systems. SEO optimizes for search rankings — getting your page to appear in Google results. GEO optimizes for AI recommendations — getting your product mentioned when someone asks an AI assistant for advice.

### How is this different from SEO?

SEO optimizes for search engine rankings — getting your page to appear in Google results. GEO optimizes for AI recommendations — getting your product mentioned when someone asks an AI what to buy. Different signals, different outputs, different technical approach. You need both, but most tools only do SEO.

### Why now?

Fifty percent of consumers now use AI to research purchases. That's up from nearly zero two years ago, growing 40% annually. By the time this is obvious to everyone, early movers will have already established their presence. This is the SEO moment of the 2020s.

### How long until I see results?

You'll start seeing results within days. When customers use web AI platforms—ChatGPT.com, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews—they're getting fresh information. Your optimized content can appear almost immediately. Much faster than SEO, which can take 6-12 months.

### Do I stay in control?

Yes. Always. We work fast, but nothing changes without your approval. AI does the heavy lifting — you make the decisions. Every change gets your sign-off before it goes live.

### Is this a one-time project?

No. This is an ongoing partnership. On an annual commitment, we monitor your AI visibility and report back every month. The AI landscape changes constantly — we stay with you and adapt.

### What does it cost?

We're free to start. Optimize your first products, see if it works, then decide. We only make money when you see value.

### My agency handles our SEO. Why do I need you?

Ask your agency: *"Across Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and Perplexity, which of our competitors are being recommended for our top 10 purchase-intent queries—and what signals are driving those recommendations versus ours?"*

If they can show you a competitive matrix with citation sources, structured data gaps, and a prioritized remediation plan, keep them. If they say "we'll look into it," that's the gap we fill.

We work with agencies too—we handle the AI visibility layer while they handle traditional search.

### How do I know it works?

You see the results directly. We show you exactly where your products appear in AI answers — and where they don't. You'll see the platforms, the queries, the competitors who are showing up instead of you. It's not a black box of "trust us, it's working." You see the data.

## ADDITIONAL Q&A

### How are you different from what I get from my SEO vendor?

Two fundamental differences:

- **Scope.** SEO optimizes for Google's crawlers—meta tags, page speed, backlinks, keyword density. We optimize for how AI systems understand and represent your brand. That means structured product data, knowledge graph presence, review aggregation, content freshness signals, and cross-platform consistency across Claude, GPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews. Your SEO vendor is optimizing for one search paradigm. We're preparing you for the next one.

- **Execution.** SEO tools generate audit reports. You get a list of what's wrong—then it's your problem to fix. We partner with you to actually implement the fixes: restructuring your product data, enriching your listings, building the content that AI systems need to recommend you confidently. We don't hand you a checklist and walk away.

### How can I measure the ROI from your services?

Sales attribution is notoriously difficult in ecommerce—that hasn't changed. But here's what you can measure:

- **Referral traffic.** When customers reach you through web AI platforms—Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT.com, Perplexity—you'll see that in your analytics just like any other referral source. We focus on browser-based AI because that's what your customers actually use. (API-based testing doesn't reflect real user experience.)

- **Return rate reduction.** Customers who get better pre-purchase information make fewer mistakes. When your product pages contain the answers users are actually asking, buyers know what they're getting. Lower returns, lower support costs.

- **Conversion rate improvement.** Better-informed visitors convert at higher rates. When your product pages contain the answers users are actually asking, buyers arrive with confidence. You should see your visit-to-purchase ratio improve.

We can help you track the impact directly. Give us access to your sales and returns data, and we'll build a before/after analysis tied to the products we optimize.

### My digital agency supports many different stores. Is there a way for us to work together to support my clients?

Yes. We partner with agencies to add AI visibility as a service layer for your clients. You keep the relationship, we provide the expertise and execution.
