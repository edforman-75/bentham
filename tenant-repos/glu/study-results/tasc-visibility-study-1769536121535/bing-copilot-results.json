A simple routine keeps it in great shape:🧼 Washing GuidelinesUse cold water. Warm or hot water can weaken the bamboo fibers over time.Choose a gentle detergent. Avoid bleach or harsh chemicals—they break down the fabric and reduce softness.Skip fabric softener. Bamboo is naturally soft; softeners can actually clog the fibers and trap odors.Turn garments inside out. This protects the outer surface and helps preserve stretch and color.Wash on a gentle cycle. Less agitation means longer-lasting performance.🌬️ Drying TipsAir dry whenever possible. Lay flat or hang—bamboo dries quickly.If you must use a dryer, choose low heat. High heat can cause shrinkage and reduce elasticity.🏃 Odor & Sweat ConsiderationsAthletic bamboo blends can hold onto sweat if not washed promptly:Rinse or wash soon after workouts.For stubborn odors, soak in a mix of cold water + a splash of white vinegar for 15–20 minutes before washing.🧺 Extra Care NotesAvoid washing with rough fabrics like denim or towels—they cause pilling.Don’t wring out bamboo clothing; press gently to remove excess water.If you want, I can help you build a simple care routine based on how often you work out or the specific brand you’re using.Edit in a page",
