## Key Findings

### 1. Miss Chase Ranks #2 Overall (Behind "AND")

Across all surfaces, Miss Chase appeared in **96 total query results**, ranking second only to the competitor "AND" which dominates with 312 appearances.

| Rank | Brand | Total Appearances | Client? |
|------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | AND | 312 | Competitor |
| 2 | **Miss Chase** | **96** | **CLIENT** |
| 3 | Myntra | 84 | Marketplace |
| 4 | Amazon | 49 | Marketplace |
| 5 | ONLY | 45 | Competitor |

| 7 | Flipkart | 34 | Marketplace |
| 8 | Zara | 32 | Competitor |
| 9 | Vero Moda | 28 | Competitor |
| 10 | AJIO | 25 | Marketplace |

### 2. Strong Performance on AI Surfaces (Perplexity, Google)

Miss Chase has better visibility on AI-powered surfaces:
- **Perplexity:** 44.2% of queries mention Miss Chase
- **Google Organic:** 43.0% of queries show Miss Chase

This is significantly higher than Bing (22.1%) and Amazon (2.6%).

### 3. Critical Gap: Generic Category Queries

When users search generic terms WITHOUT "Miss Chase" in the query (e.g., "best jeans brands India"):

| Surface | Miss Chase Visibility |
|---------|----------------------|
| Amazon India | 80% (8/10 queries) |
| Perplexity | 7% (1/14 queries) |
| Google | 0% (0/14 queries) |
| Bing | 0% (0/14 queries) |

**Key Insight:** Miss Chase only appears when users already know the brand. The brand is invisible to users discovering products through generic searches on Google/Bing/Perplexity.

### 4. Amazon is the Exception

On Amazon India, Miss Chase products appear in 80% of generic category queries, with:
- 44 total product appearances
- Optimized product types (bootcut, wide-leg, jumpsuits) outperforming non-optimized (skinny jeans)

### 5. ChaseHaul.com is Invisible to AI

Products listed only on chasehaul.com (not on Amazon) have **zero visibility** across all AI surfaces:
- 0 citations on Perplexity
- 0 results on Google
- 0 results on Bing

---

## Optimized vs Non-Optimized Products

Analysis of 12 content-optimized products vs non-optimized products:

| Metric | Optimized Types | Non-Optimized |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Amazon appearances | 24 | 20 |
| Avg. search position | 10.9 | 11.1 |

**Conclusion:** Content optimization shows marginal benefit (~20% more appearances), but distribution channel (Amazon vs chasehaul.com only) has a much larger impact on visibility.
