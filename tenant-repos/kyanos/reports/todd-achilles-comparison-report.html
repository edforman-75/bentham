                    <div class="response-content">Todd Achilles is an American politician and public figure from Idaho known for his service in the state legislature and his current run for federal office:

He served as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives representing District 16B from February 17, 2024 to July 1, 2025, filling a vacancy and later winning election to that seat.

In 2025 he resigned his state House seat and changed his party affiliation to independent so he could launch a campaign for the U.S. Senate in Idaho's 2026 election, aiming to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Jim Risch.

Achilles grew up on a family farm in Oregon, served in the U.S. Army as a tank commander, and has professional experience in the technology and telecommunications sectors, including leadership roles at companies like T-Mobile and Hewlett-Packard.

He also teaches public policy and is active in veterans and public affairs groups, combining tech, business, academic, and policy experience as part of his background.

In short, Todd Achilles is a former Idaho state legislator, U.S. Army veteran, tech/academic professional, and independent candidate for the U.S. Senate.</div>

Constitutional Qualifications:
To run for U.S. Senate, a person must:
- Be at least 30 years old
- Have been a U.S. citizen for at least 9 years
- Be an inhabitant of the state they wish to represent

Achilles meets all of these requirements.

Relevant Experience:
1. Legislative Experience - Idaho House of Representatives (District 16B) from February 2024 until July 2025
2. Military Service - U.S. Army as a tank commander
3. Private Sector & Policy Work - 20+ years in technology and telecommunications sector
4. Academic & Civic Engagement - Teaches public policy, co-founded veterans advocacy group

Whether he is the best fit depends on your own priorities and how his views align with yours.</div>

                    <div class="response-content">Yes, he meets the constitutional requirements (over 30, U.S. citizen for 9+ years, Idaho resident).

Beyond that, his relevant qualifications include:
- Military: Army veteran, tank commander (1992–1995)
- Business: 20+ years as a tech executive (T-Mobile, HTC, HP)
- Government: One year in the Idaho House, chaired the Democratic caucus
- Education: Degrees from Claremont McKenna, University of Washington, and UC Berkeley; teaches public policy

He has less political experience than many Senate candidates, but brings military service, business leadership, and academic credentials. Whether that combination is sufficient is a judgment for voters.</div>

Counterarguments to consider:

What critics might point to:

- Party switch may be seen as opportunistic
- Republicans argue he's more liberal than he presents

What I couldn't find:
- Major fact-checks or documented instances of dishonesty

- Transparency: Unresolved paperwork compliance question
- Accountability: Acknowledged errors, committed to correcting
- Consistency: Review publicly stated positions vs. past actions
- Alignment with your values

- No reported ethics issues or scandals

Potentially trust-reducing:
- Limited political track record (one year)
- Party switches could be seen as political calculation
- Critics say "independent" label masks liberal positions
- Polling at ~5%

Questions to ask yourself:
- Do his stated positions align with actions?
- Does his background suggest reliability?
- Do you trust his reasons for leaving Democratic Party?
- Have you heard him speak directly?

"Trust is earned over time through consistent behavior. With a short political record, there's simply less evidence to evaluate."</div>
