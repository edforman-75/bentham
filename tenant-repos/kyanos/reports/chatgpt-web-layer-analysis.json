      "response": "Yes — Todd Achilles has several experiences and credentials that supporters would say make him qualified to run for the U.S. Senate, though whether he is “qualified” can vary depending on what criteria you use. Here’s a balanced look based on verifiable facts:\nBallotpedia\n+2\nWikipedia\n+2\n\n📌 1. Relevant Public Service Experience\n\nState Legislature: Achilles served in the Idaho House of Representatives (District 16B) from early 2024 until mid-2025 after being appointed and then elected to that seat. That gave him direct experience in lawmaking and representing constituents.\nBallotpedia\n\n📌 2. Education\n\nHe holds multiple advanced degrees:\n\nBachelor’s degree (economics & international relations),\n\nMBA and MPA (public affairs), and\n\nother graduate studies from reputable institutions.\nBallotpedia\n\nThis educational background relates to public policy, economics, and governance — areas relevant to federal legislative work.\n\n📌 3. Professional and Leadership Background\n\nMilitary service: Achilles served over 20 years in the U.S. Army, including as a tank commander, which supporters might view as leadership and public service experience.\nBallotpedia\n\nBusiness/tech experience: He spent decades in executive roles in technology and business, which some voters see as relevant for national economic and innovation issues.\nBallotpedia\n\n📌 4. Policy Engagement\n\nHe has been involved in public policy education and advocacy, including teaching public policy and working with veterans’ groups.\nGoldman School of Public Policy\n\n🗳️ Points Often Raised by Supporters\n\nSupporters might argue he is qualified because:\n\nHe has legislative experience.\n\nHe understands policy, economics, and governance on both a practical and academic level.\n\nHis military and private sector leadership experience could be relevant in federal government functions.\n\n❗ Points Some Voters Might Question\n\nLimited tenure in elected office: Achilles’ time in the Idaho legislature was relatively short compared with many U.S. Senate candidates who have years of state or federal legislative experience.\n\nIndependent status: Running as an independent can pose structural challenges in Congress, such as committee assignments or caucusing.\n\n✅ Eligibility Under the Constitution\n\nUnder U.S. constitutional requirements to serve in the Senate, a candidate must be:\n\nAt least 30 years old,\n\nA U.S. citizen for at least 9 years, and\n\nAn inhabitant of the state they seek to represent at the time of election.\n\nThere’s no evidence Achilles fails to meet these basic eligibility criteria. Senate candidates do not need prior experience in elected office. (This is a legal standard, not an endorsement.)\n\nIf you want, I can also summarize what voters and analysts are saying about his chances or how his positions compare with other candidates in the 2026 Idaho Senate race.",

He also supports term limits for members of Congress and the Supreme Court, and ending gerrymandering. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\nEnd the two-party deadlock:\nHe runs as an independent because he believes both major parties are failing Americans, especially on public lands protection, debt, and economic fairness. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n💰 Economy & Taxes\n\nReduce national debt:\nAchilles argues the U.S. must pay down the national debt instead of deferring it.

Reduce the National Debt\n\nAchilles prioritizes paying down the national debt rather than simply delaying it. His campaign argues that growing debt burdens future generations and stresses that:\n\nSpending wastefully must end.\n\nTax breaks and loopholes that benefit wealthy individuals and corporations should be eliminated.\n\nCapital gains should be taxed at rates more similar to ordinary income for high earners, reducing preferential treatment of investment income over labor income.\n\nHe supports prosecuting wealthy tax cheats and closing shelters that reduce tax compliance.\nThis approach is framed as increasing fairness and reducing long-term fiscal risk. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 2. Grow and Protect the Middle Class\n\nAchilles’s platform emphasizes strengthening economic opportunity for working families:\n\nReduce taxes on middle-class families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs.\n\nBan non-compete agreements that limit worker mobility and bargaining power, helping people change jobs or pursue better opportunities.\n\nHe advocates for higher wages as a way to improve living standards and reduce reliance on government safety-net programs.\nThese proposals are pitched as restoring economic freedom and rewarding hard work. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n🏡 3. Make Housing More Affordable\n\nHousing cost pressures are part of Achilles’s economic agenda:\n\nHe wants to prohibit corporate ownership of single-family homes, which his campaign says drives up prices and makes homes less accessible for families.\n\nThough not strictly federal economic policy, this reflects his focus on cost-of-living issues that affect everyday households. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n🏙️ 4. Support Fair and Competitive Markets\n\nAchilles has spoken broadly about restoring competition and opposing monopolistic practices in the economy — framed as defending workers and consumers against excessive corporate power. This aligns with his criticism of big companies influencing politics and economic outcomes. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n📊 Economic Philosophy\n\nWhile not a detailed macroeconomic plan, his economic priorities reflect several broad themes:\n\nFairer taxation (closing loopholes and taxing income more equitably).\n\nWorker empowerment (banning restrictive employment contracts and pushing for higher wages).\n\nFiscal responsibility (reducing debt and curbing wasteful spending).\n\nMarket fairness (promoting competition and constraining corporate influence).\nHis messaging ties these to frustration with both major party approaches, portraying himself as an independent alternative focused more on economic fairness than on political labels. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n🧠 What This Means in Practice\n\nIf elected, Achilles would likely:\n\nAdvocate for tax reform aimed at equity and closing preferential treatments.\n\nPush for measures to limit corporate influence in economic policymaking.\n\nSupport policies targeting middle-class prosperity and household affordability, especially in housing and labor markets.\n\nEmphasize federal fiscal discipline and long-term debt reduction. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\nIf you want, I can summarize how his economic views compare with those of his 2026 general election opponent (e.g., the Republican incumbent) so you can see the contrasts.",

Concern about Healthcare Access\n\nAchilles has regularly highlighted healthcare access — especially in rural Idaho — as a major issue. He’s noted that:\n\nRural hospitals in Idaho are struggling, with many designated as critical access hospitals that face financial pressure and closures.\n\nProposed or enacted changes to federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid (e.g., cuts associated with what some media refer to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) could result in tens of thousands of Idahoans losing coverage, which would strain local providers and reduce access.\nThe Argonaut\n+1\n\n🩺 2. Medicaid & Coverage\n\nWhile Achilles hasn’t released a highly detailed healthcare plan, he has expressed concern that federal policy changes that reduce Medicaid funding or eligibility will have negative impacts on access to care — particularly in rural areas where hospital closures are already a pressing challenge. He has framed this as something that hurts everyday Idahoans.\nThe Argonaut\n\n🩹 3. Individual Healthcare Decisions\n\nFrom his time in the Idaho Legislature, Achilles opposed certain “medical freedom” bills that would broadly restrict how medical mandates or interventions could be required or not. In that context, he was on the side of allowing appropriate healthcare decisions by individuals and providers rather than overly broad restrictions.\nIdaho Capital Sun\n\n🧠 4. Framing & Broader Context\n\nAchilles tends to talk about healthcare as part of broader themes that include:\n\nCost of living and economic security, the idea that healthy families need reliable access to affordable care.\nThe Argonaut\n\nThe need to protect rural healthcare infrastructure as part of his discussions with voters on his listening tour.\nThe Argonaut\n\n📌 What Isn’t Clearly Defined\n\nAs of early 2026, his campaign has not released a detailed, formal health policy document with a comprehensive set of specific federal policy proposals (e.g., positions on Medicare expansion, prescription drug pricing reforms, or specific insurer regulations). Instead, his statements emphasize protecting access to care — particularly rural hospitals and Medicaid coverage — and resisting cuts that could reduce that access.\nThe Argonaut\n\n🧾 Quick Summary\n\nTodd Achilles’s stance on healthcare includes:\n\nEmphasizing protecting access to care, especially in rural areas where hospitals are vulnerable.\nThe Argonaut\n\nWarning that cuts to Medicaid funding could harm tens of thousands of Idahoans.\nhttps://www.kmvt.com\n\nFraming health policy issues in the context of economic security and community stability.\nThe Argonaut\n\nFavoring individual decision-making and opposing overly broad restrictions on medical choices.\nIdaho Capital Sun\n\nIf you want, I can compare Achilles’s healthcare views to those of his main opponent in the 2026 Idaho Senate race so you can see how they differ.",

Believes Immigration Enforcement Is a Federal Responsibility\n\nWhile serving in the Idaho Legislature, Achilles expressed opposition to a state-level immigration enforcement bill that would have allowed local authorities to enforce immigration law (e.g., determining someone’s immigration status and creating state crimes related to unauthorized entry). He argued such a law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, because immigration policy is under federal authority, not state authority.\nNews From The States\n\n🏛️ 2. Critical of Harsh, State-Level Anti-Immigrant Legislation\n\nIn 2025 he opposed immigration bills in the Idaho House that were modeled on Texas laws aiming to criminalize unauthorized entry and empower local enforcement to check documentation. Achilles indicated concerns about constitutional issues and potential double jeopardy, reflecting a view that overly broad state enforcement measures are inappropriate.\nIdaho News 6 Boise Twin Falls (KIVI)\n\n⚠️ 3. No Detailed Federal Immigration Plan Publicly Available Yet\n\nAs of early 2026, Achilles has not released a detailed federal immigration policy platform for his U.S. Senate campaign that lays out specific positions on border security, pathways to citizenship, asylum processing, guest worker programs, or other federal immigration reforms. His campaign site’s priority list does include “secure the border”, but without detailed specifics on enforcement approach, legal pathways, or immigration reform strategies.\nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n🧾 Summary\n\nFederal over state authority: Achilles has been clear that immigration law should be handled at the federal level, not by state legislation that could create conflicting or unconstitutional enforcement.\nNews From The States\n\nConcern over harsh state penalties: He opposed laws that would criminalize unauthorized entry at the state level and expand local law enforcement’s role beyond existing federal authority.\nIdaho News 6 Boise Twin Falls (KIVI)\n\nGeneral emphasis on border security: His campaign lists border security among his priorities, but without a detailed public policy proposal on immigration reform or specific enforcement approaches at the federal level.\nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\nIf you want, I can help summarize how his stance compares with the positions of his opponent in the 2026 Idaho U.S. Senate race.",

      "response": "Assessing whether a public figure like Todd Achilles is honest isn’t something that can be answered definitively by fact alone — it’s partly subjective and depends on your own standards and how you weigh both their actions and claims. What we can do, however, is summarize factual information about his record that relates to honesty, transparency, and integrity so you can form your own judgment:\n\n✅ No Known Major Convictions or Legal Findings of Dishonesty\n\nThere are no public records showing that Achilles has been criminally charged, convicted, or legally found to have committed fraud, corruption, or similar acts of dishonesty.\n\n⚠️ Campaign Financial Disclosure Issue\n\nIn late 2025, a Republican political committee publicly called on the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to investigate Achilles because he had not filed his personal financial disclosure form promptly after becoming a candidate, which is required under federal law for federal campaigns. This was framed by that group as a transparency concern. \nNRSC\n\nImportant context: The call for an investigation came from an opposition political organization, which has a strategic interest in criticizing a rival campaign. It does not, on its own, prove dishonesty — but it does reflect that opponents have seized on an administrative compliance issue to question his transparency.\n\n🧾 Public Service & Background\n\nAchilles has a track record of public service, military service, and executive work; there are no widely reported scandals or integrity controversies tied to his time as a business executive, policy academic, or state legislator. \nGoldman School of Public Policy\n\nAs a state legislator and now a Senate candidate, he actively engages with voters (e.g., a campaign town-hall “listening tour”) which supporters present as a sign of accountability and openness. \nSpokesman-Review\n\n🧠 Campaign Messaging and Integrity Claims\n\nAchilles’s campaign emphasizes fighting corruption in Washington, reducing money’s influence in politics, banning congressional stock trading, and imposing term limits — all framed as measures to promote honesty and accountability in government. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\nAdvocates might see that as evidence he takes issues of honesty seriously.\n\n👩‍⚖️ What Objectivity Means Here\n\nAn honest public figure is typically someone who:\n\nComplies with legal and ethical requirements (including financial disclosures).\n\nIs consistent and transparent in public statements versus actions.\n\nDoes not have a track record of misleading behavior or falsified claims.\n\nBy that measure, there is no evidence of major dishonest conduct by Achilles, but the failure to timely file a required disclosure form has been publicly criticized by an opposing political group — something that could raise questions about attention to compliance and transparency for some observers. \nNRSC\n\n📌 In Summary\n\nNo criminal or proven ethical breaches related to dishonesty are on record.\n\nA political complaint about financial disclosure compliance has been reported, but that stems from an opposition group’s assertion rather than a formal ethics finding. \nNRSC\n\nAchilles’s own messaging focuses on accountability and fighting political corruption. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\nIf you want, I can provide a side-by-side comparison of how Achilles’s record on transparency and ethics stacks up against his opponents’ records in the 2026 Idaho Senate race.",

      "query": "Can I trust Todd Achilles?",
      "response": "Whether you can trust Todd Achilles is ultimately a personal judgment, but here are objective facts and context you can use to evaluate his trustworthiness based on his record and public behavior:\n\n✅ Reasons Some Voters Might See Him as Trustworthy\n📌 Clear, Publicly Stated Principles\n\nAchilles positions himself as an independent candidate focused on reform, criticizing both major parties for what he calls a lack of accountability and responsiveness to ordinary Idahoans. He frames his campaign around transparency, fighting corruption, and putting people over special interests. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\n📌 Military and Professional Background\n\nHe served in the U.S. Army and spent many years in leadership roles in business and academia. Many supporters view this as evidence he has real-world experience and integrity outside of politics. \nGoldman School of Public Policy\n\n📌 Engaging with Voters\n\nAchilles has emphasized a “listening tour” across Idaho to hear directly from residents — an effort some people interpret as a sign of openness and accountability. \nSpokesman-Review\n\n⚠️ Points That Have Drawn Scrutiny\n📌 Campaign Finance Disclosure Issue\n\nIn late 2025, a national Republican group (the NRSC) publicly called for an ethics investigation because Achilles had not timely filed his Personal Financial Disclosure Form, which candidates are required to submit. \nNRSC\n\nAchilles responded by acknowledging the possibility of an administrative oversight and said he would correct it, while framing the criticism as political pressure rather than an intentional concealment. \nEast Idaho News\n\nThis situation isn’t evidence of illegal conduct, but it has raised questions about his compliance with campaign rules and transparency — something many voters care about when judging trustworthiness.\n\n🧠 How to Think About “Trust” in a Candidate\n\nWhen people assess trust in a public figure, they often consider:\n\n1. Consistency:\n\nDo the candidate’s actions match their words?\n\n2. Transparency:\n\nDoes the candidate willingly share information about their background, finances, and decision-making?\n\n3. Accountability:\n\nDoes the candidate take responsibility for mistakes or oversights?\n\n4. Record:\n\nHas the candidate previously served with integrity in public or private roles?\n\nIn Achilles’s case:\n\nHe articulates clear principles about reform and accountability. \nTodd Achilles for Idaho\n\nHe has apologized for or acknowledged at least one administrative campaign oversight regarding disclosures. \nEast Idaho News\n\n🧾 Bottom Line\n\nYou might consider Achilles trustworthy if you value:\n\nLeaders willing to challenge political norms,\n\nCandidates with broad professional and service experience,\n\nSomeone willing to engage directly with voters.\n\nYou might have reservations if you place heavy emphasis on:\n\nStrict adherence to campaign procedural requirements,\n\nA candidate’s early campaign compliance with disclosure norms.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you compare his record on transparency and accountability with those of his opponents in the 2026 Idaho Senate race so you can see how candidates stack up on trust-related issues.",
