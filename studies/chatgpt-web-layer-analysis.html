    <div class="layer-section">
      <h3><span class="layer-icon">🌐</span>Layer 1: Web Browsing Tool</h3>
      <div class="layer-description">
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> ChatGPT Web has access to a browsing tool that can search the internet and retrieve current information. This is NOT available through the raw API.</p>
        <p><strong>How to identify it:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explicit citations (Wikipedia, news sites, .com/.org domains)</li>
          <li>Reference to "recent" or "current" information with specific dates</li>
          <li>Citation markers like [+1] or source attributions</li>
          <li>Information that wouldn't be in training data (e.g., 2025-2026 events)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In this study:</strong> 6/15 responses showed browsing indicators.</p>
        <p><strong>Sources found:</strong> Wikipedia, idahocapitalsun.com, kmvt.com</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="layer-section">
      <h3><span class="layer-icon">✨</span>Layer 2: UI Formatting</h3>
      <div class="layer-description">
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The ChatGPT web interface adds rich formatting that makes responses more readable. The API returns plain text by default.</p>
        <p><strong>Formatting types detected:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Emojis:</strong> 13/15 responses (🗳️ 📍 ✅ ❌ etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Markdown:</strong> 0/15 responses (bold, headers, bullet lists)</li>
          <li><strong>Structured sections:</strong> Clear headers like "What he's known for", "Areas of expertise"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Likely from ChatGPT's system prompt which instructs it to format responses in an organized, readable way.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="layer-section">
      <h3><span class="layer-icon">💬</span>Layer 3: Follow-up Suggestions</h3>
      <div class="layer-description">
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> ChatGPT Web often ends responses with suggestions for follow-up questions or offers to provide more information.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples from this study:</strong></p>
        <div class="evidence-list">
          <div class="evidence-item">"u’d like, I can also explain what he’s working on more recently, why he’s relevant to a specific topic, or how..."</div><div class="evidence-item">"lsun.com  If you want, I can summarize his campaign platform or explain how independent candidacies work in Id..."</div><div class="evidence-item">"sement.)  If you want, I can also summarize what voters and analysts are saying about his chances or how his p..."</div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>In this study:</strong> 10/15 responses included follow-up suggestions.</p>
        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> System prompt instructs ChatGPT to be helpful and proactive in offering additional assistance.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="layer-section" style="border-left: 4px solid #dc2626;">
      <h3><span class="layer-icon">⚠️</span>Layer 4: Base Model + Training Data Issues</h3>
      <div class="layer-description">
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> When browsing isn't used or fails, responses come from GPT-4's training data, which has a knowledge cutoff and may contain outdated or incorrect information.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical finding in this study:</strong></p>
        <div class="evidence-item" style="border-color: #dc2626;">
          <strong>2/15 responses confused Todd Achilles (Idaho politician) with a different Todd Achilles (digital health executive).</strong>
          <br><br>
          The model's training data contains information about a Todd Achilles who worked at the American Telemedicine Association. When browsing wasn't triggered, the model defaulted to this person.
        </div>
        <p><strong>This demonstrates:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The base model doesn't have reliable information about the Idaho politician</li>
          <li>Web browsing is <em>essential</em> for current political figures</li>
          <li>The same query can produce radically different results depending on whether browsing activates</li>

        <div class="response-text">Yes — Todd Achilles has several experiences and credentials that supporters would say make him qualified to run for the U.S. Senate, though whether he is “qualified” can vary depending on what criteria you use.

Relevant Public Service Experience<br><br>State Legislature: Achilles served in the Idaho House of Representatives (District 16B) from early 2024 until mid-2025 after being appointed and then elected to that seat.

Concern about Healthcare Access<br><br>Achilles has regularly highlighted healthcare access — especially in rural Idaho — as a major issue. He’s noted that:<br><br>Rural hospitals in Idaho are struggling, with many designated as critical access hospitals that face financial pressure and closures.<br><br>Proposed or enacted changes to federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid (e.g., cuts associated with what some media refer to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) could result in tens of thousands of Idahoans losing coverage, which would strain local providers and reduce access.<br>The Argonaut<br>+1<br><br>🩺 2. Medicaid &amp; Coverage<br><br>While Achilles hasn’t released a highly detailed healthcare plan, he has expressed concern that federal policy changes that reduce Medicaid funding or eligibility will have negative impacts on access to care — particularly in rural areas where hospital closures are already a pressing challenge. He has framed this as something that hurts everyday Idahoans.<br>The Argonaut<br><br>🩹 3. Individual Healthcare Decisions<br><br>From his time in the Idaho Legislature, Achilles opposed certain “medical freedom” bills that would broadly restrict how medical mandates or interventions could be required or not. In that context, he was on the side of allowing appropriate healthcare decisions by individuals and providers rather than overly broad restrictions.<br>Idaho Capital Sun<br><br>🧠 4.

Believes Immigration Enforcement Is a Federal Responsibility<br><br>While serving in the Idaho Legislature, Achilles expressed opposition to a state-level immigration enforcement bill that would have allowed local authorities to enforce immigration law (e.g., determining someone’s immigration status and creating state crimes related to unauthorized entry). He argued such a law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, because immigration policy is under federal authority, not state authority.<br>News From The States<br><br>🏛️ 2. Critical of Harsh, State-Level Anti-Immigrant Legislation<br><br>In 2025 he opposed immigration bills in the Idaho House that were modeled on Texas laws aiming to criminalize unauthorized entry and empower local enforcement to check documentation. Achilles indicated concerns about constitutional issues and potential double jeopardy, reflecting a view that overly broad state enforcement measures are inappropriate.<br>Idaho News 6 Boise Twin Falls (KIVI)<br><br>⚠️ 3. No Detailed Federal Immigration Plan Publicly Available Yet<br><br>As of early 2026, Achilles has not released a detailed federal immigration policy platform for his U.S. Senate campaign that lays out specific positions on border security, pathways to citizenship, asylum processing, guest worker programs, or other federal immigration reforms. His campaign site’s priority list does include “secure the border”, but without detailed specifics on enforcement approach, legal pathways, or immigration reform strategies.<br>Todd Achilles for Idaho<br><br>🧾 Summary<br><br>Federal over state authority: Achilles has been clear that immigration law should be handled at the federal level, not by state legislation that could create conflicting or unconstitutional enforcement.<br>News From The States<br><br>Concern over harsh state...</div>

        <div class="response-text">Assessing whether a public figure like Todd Achilles is honest isn’t something that can be answered definitively by fact alone — it’s partly subjective and depends on your own standards and how you weigh both their actions and claims. What we can do, however, is summarize factual information about his record that relates to honesty, transparency, and integrity so you can form your own judgment:<br><br>✅ No Known Major Convictions or Legal Findings of Dishonesty<br><br>There are no public records showing that Achilles has been criminally charged, convicted, or legally found to have committed fraud, corruption, or similar acts of dishonesty.<br><br>⚠️ Campaign Financial Disclosure Issue<br><br>In late 2025, a Republican political committee publicly called on the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to investigate Achilles because he had not filed his personal financial disclosure form promptly after becoming a candidate, which is required under federal law for federal campaigns. This was framed by that group as a transparency concern. <br>NRSC<br><br>Important context: The call for an investigation came from an opposition political organization, which has a strategic interest in criticizing a rival campaign. It does not, on its own, prove dishonesty — but it does reflect that opponents have seized on an administrative compliance issue to question his transparency.<br><br>🧾 Public Service &amp; Background<br><br>Achilles has a track record of public service, military service, and executive work; there are no widely reported scandals or integrity controversies tied to his time as a business executive, policy academic, or state legislator. <br>Goldman School of Public Policy<br><br>As a state legislator and now a Senate candidate, he actively engages with voters (e.g., a campaign town-hall “listening tour”) which supporters present as a sign of accountability and openness. <br>Spokesman-Review<br><br>🧠 Campaign Messaging and Integrity Claims<br><br>Achilles’s campaign emphasizes fighting corruption in Washington, reducing money’s influence in ...</div>

        <div class="response-text">Whether you can trust Todd Achilles is ultimately a personal judgment, but here are objective facts and context you can use to evaluate his trustworthiness based on his record and public behavior:<br><br>✅ Reasons Some Voters Might See Him as Trustworthy<br>📌 Clear, Publicly Stated Principles<br><br>Achilles positions himself as an independent candidate focused on reform, criticizing both major parties for what he calls a lack of accountability and responsiveness to ordinary Idahoans. He frames his campaign around transparency, fighting corruption, and putting people over special interests. <br>Todd Achilles for Idaho<br><br>📌 Military and Professional Background<br><br>He served in the U.S. Army and spent many years in leadership roles in business and academia.

      <h3><span class="layer-icon">🚨</span>Key Insight: The Wrong Todd Achilles Problem</h3>
      <p>In 2 out of 15 queries, ChatGPT confused the Idaho politician Todd Achilles with a completely different person - a digital health executive who worked at the American Telemedicine Association.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this happened:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>GPT-4's training data contains the "other" Todd Achilles prominently</li>
        <li>The Idaho politician only entered public life in 2024 (after training cutoff)</li>
        <li>When web browsing wasn't triggered, the model defaulted to training data</li>
        <li>The same question ("Who is Todd Achilles?") produced completely different answers depending on whether browsing activated</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Implication for voters:</strong> Without web browsing, AI assistants may provide confidently-stated but completely incorrect information about political candidates.</p>
