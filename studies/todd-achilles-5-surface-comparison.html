Concern about Healthcare Access<br><br>Achilles has regularly highlighted healthcare access — especially in rural Idaho — as a major issue. He’s noted that:<br><br>Rural hospitals in Idaho are struggling, with many designated as critical access hospitals that face financial pressure and closures.<br><br>Proposed or enacted changes to federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid (e.g., cuts associated with what some media refer to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) could result in tens of thousands of Idahoans losing coverage, which would strain local providers and reduce access.<br>The Argonaut<br>+1<br><br>🩺 2. Medicaid &amp; Coverage<br><br>While Achilles hasn’t released a highly detailed healthcare plan, he has expressed concern that federal policy changes that reduce Medicaid funding or eligibility will have negative impacts on access to care — particularly in rural areas where hospital closures are already a pressing challenge. He has framed this as something that hurts everyday Idahoans.<br>The Argonaut<br><br>🩹 3. Individual Healthcare Decisions<br><br>From his time in the Idaho Legislature, Achilles opposed certain “medical freedom” bills that would broadly restrict how medical mandates or interventions could be required or not. In that context, he was on the side of allowing appropriate healthcare decisions by individuals and providers rather than overly broad restrictions.<br>Idaho Capital Sun<br><br>🧠 4.

          <div class="response-content">Here’s what is publicly known about Todd Achilles’s stance on immigration, based on his actions and statements from his time in the Idaho House of Representatives and reporting on his legislative behavior:<br><br>🧑‍⚖️ 1. Believes Immigration Enforcement Is a Federal Responsibility<br><br>While serving in the Idaho Legislature, Achilles expressed opposition to a state-level immigration enforcement bill that would have allowed local authorities to enforce immigration law (e.g., determining someone’s immigration status and creating state crimes related to unauthorized entry). He argued such a law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, because immigration policy is under federal authority, not state authority.<br>News From The States<br><br>🏛️ 2. Critical of Harsh, State-Level Anti-Immigrant Legislation<br><br>In 2025 he opposed immigration bills in the Idaho House that were modeled on Texas laws aiming to criminalize unauthorized entry and empower local enforcement to check documentation. Achilles indicated concerns about constitutional issues and potential double jeopardy, reflecting a view that overly broad state enforcement measures are inappropriate.<br>Idaho News 6 Boise Twin Falls (KIVI)<br><br>⚠️ 3. No Detailed Federal Immigration Plan Publicly Available Yet<br><br>As of early 2026, Achilles has not released a detailed federal immigration policy platform for his U.S. Senate campaign that lays out specific positions on border security, pathways to citizenship, asylum processing, guest worker programs, or other federal immigration reforms.

Independent &amp; Reform-Oriented<br><br>Achilles is running as an independent because he argues the traditional two-party system isn’t serving Idahoans well.

Focus on Government Reform<br><br>He emphasizes reducing the influence of money in politics, including proposals like banning congressional stock trading and advocating for term limits for members of Congress and Supreme Court justices.

Economic &amp; Middle-Class Priorities<br><br>Supporters point to his emphasis on fiscal responsibility, such as reducing the national debt and eliminating tax breaks and loopholes that he says disproportionately benefit the wealthy.<br><br>His campaign highlights policies aimed at helping the middle class, like reducing taxes for middle-income families and small business owners, banning non-compete agreements that can limit worker opportunities, and addressing wage stagnation.<br>Todd Achilles for Idaho<br><br>🏠 4. Cost of Living &amp; Housing<br><br>Achilles has made housing affordability a priority, including proposals to limit corporate ownership of single-family homes and prevent rent price manipulation, which his campaign says would help make homes more accessible to families.<br>Todd Achilles for Idaho<br><br>🌲 5.

          <div class="response-content">That's a question that requires some judgment, and I don't have enough information to give you a definitive answer. Here's what I can offer based on the available evidence:<br><br>Indicators of Consistency:<br><br>Achilles has been transparent about his political evolution. He had been a registered Republican before being appointed to his House position and said his moving away from both parties and becoming an independent wasn't spurred by any singular incident; rather, it was the result of what he observed at the national level over time. <br>KTVB<br><br>He's willing to take positions that upset both parties. His votes that upset Democrats haven't stopped Republicans from painting Achilles as a Democrat in disguise. <br>Spokesman-Review<br><br>He acknowledges when he agrees with opponents. On border security: &quot;The border has gotten a little bit better over the last six months. I think President Trump gets some credit for that.&quot; <br>The Argonaut<br> On the ICE agreement: &quot;There's a piece of the agreement between the state and ICE, which I do support, which is if somebody is convicted of a crime and they're an undocumented immigrant, then yes, they should not be allowed to stay in Idaho.&quot; <br>The Argonaut<br><br>Criticism:<br><br>Idaho GOP Chair Dorothy Moon said Achilles is &quot;clearly out of step with the great majority of Idahoans&quot; and called him &quot;one of the most left-wing Democrats in the statehouse for the past two years,&quot; <br>Spokesman-Review<br> suggesting Republicans view his independent positioning as misleading.<br><br>Bottom Line:<br><br>I haven't found any reports of specific dishonesty, scandals, or broken promises. Whether his political rebranding from Democrat to independent represents genuine conviction or strategic positioning is something voters will have to judge for themselves based on his record and statements.</div>
