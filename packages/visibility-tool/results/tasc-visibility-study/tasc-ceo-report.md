# TASC Performance Web Visibility Assessment

**January 2026 | United States Market**

Measuring TASC Performance's presence across the consumer discovery journey: search engines, AI assistants, and shopping platforms.

---

## Executive Summary

This assessment measures how visible TASC Performance is when consumers search for athletic apparel, bamboo clothing, and sustainable activewear. We tested 90 queries across the platforms where consumers actually discover and research products: Google, Bing, ChatGPT, and Amazon.

**Key Finding:** TASC dominates Google and ChatGPT visibility but has a critical blind spot in Bing search. This uneven presence means TASC is invisible to millions of potential customers who use Microsoft's ecosystem.

### TASC Visibility by Platform

| Platform | Visibility | Queries | Status |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Google Search** | **80%** | 72 of 90 | Leading position vs competitors |
| **ChatGPT** | **79%** | 57 of 72 | Strong AI visibility |
| **Amazon** | **31%** | 26 of 85 | Room for improvement |
| **Bing Search** | **2%** | 2 of 90 | Critical gap |

## TASC vs. Competitors: Cross-Platform Summary

| Brand | Google | ChatGPT | Amazon | Bing |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|------|
| **TASC Performance** | **80%** | **79%** | **31%** | **2%** |
| Lululemon | 14% | 14% | 2% | 3% |
| Vuori | 12% | 8% | *† | 2% |
| Nike | 11% | 7% | 1% | - |
| Under Armour | 9% | 17% | 4% | 2% |
| Free Fly | 8% | 4% | *† | - |
| Rhone | 7% | 4% | 2% | 1% |
| Patagonia | 7% | 3% | - | - |
| Cariloha | 6% | 3% | 1% | 1% |

*† Products available via resellers, not official brand presence.*

**TASC Leads in Google and ChatGPT:** TASC significantly outperforms all competitors in Google and ChatGPT visibility for queries about bamboo clothing, sustainable activewear, and comfortable athletic apparel. This competitive advantage is substantial: TASC appears 5-8x more often than Lululemon, Vuori, and Nike.

**But Bing Is a Blind Spot:** TASC's 2% Bing visibility is the lowest among major competitors. When consumers use Bing, Microsoft Edge, Windows Search, or Microsoft Copilot, they find competitors instead of TASC.

## Google Search Visibility

Google remains the dominant search engine where most consumers begin their product research. Google now includes AI-generated overviews alongside traditional organic results for many queries.

- **TASC Visibility:** 80%
- **Queries Appearing:** 72 of 90
- **Rank vs Competitors:** #1

### TASC vs. Competitors on Google

| Brand | Queries | % of Queries |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **TASC Performance** | **72** | **80.0%** |
| REI (retailer) | 13 | 14.4% |
| Lululemon | 13 | 14.4% |
| Vuori | 11 | 12.2% |
| Nike | 10 | 11.1% |
| Under Armour | 8 | 8.9% |
| Free Fly | 7 | 7.8% |
| Patagonia | 6 | 6.7% |
| Rhone | 6 | 6.7% |
| Cariloha | 5 | 5.6% |

**Why Google Works for TASC:**
- Strong website authority and domain reputation
- Comprehensive product content with relevant keywords
- Content about bamboo technology establishes expertise
- Good structured data on product pages

---

## Bing Search Visibility

Bing powers Microsoft's entire ecosystem: Copilot AI assistant, Edge browser, Windows Search, and Cortana. TASC's near-zero visibility here is the most critical gap identified in this study.

- **TASC Visibility:** 2.2%
- **Queries Appearing:** 2 of 90
- **Rank vs Competitors:** Last

**CRITICAL GAP:** Out of 90 queries tested, TASC Performance appeared in only 2 Bing search results. This means consumers using Bing, Microsoft Edge, Windows Search, or Microsoft Copilot do not find TASC when researching athletic apparel.

### Who Uses Bing?
- **Enterprise users:** Many corporate environments default to Bing/Edge
- **Windows users:** Windows Search and Cortana use Bing
- **Microsoft Copilot users:** The AI assistant is built on Bing's index
- **100+ million daily users:** Bing has significant market share

### Likely Causes of Poor Bing Visibility
- Website not properly submitted to Bing Webmaster Tools
- Bing's crawler may have indexing issues with the site
- No Bing-specific SEO or advertising presence
- IndexNow protocol not implemented for real-time indexing

---

## ChatGPT Visibility

ChatGPT (chatgpt.com) has become a primary research tool for consumers. When people ask for product recommendations, ChatGPT's responses increasingly influence purchase decisions.

- **TASC Visibility:** 79%
- **Queries Appearing:** 57 of 72
- **Rank vs Competitors:** #1

### TASC vs. Competitors on ChatGPT

| Brand | Queries | % of Queries |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **TASC Performance** | **57** | **79.2%** |
| REI (retailer) | 16 | 22.2% |
| Under Armour | 12 | 16.7% |
| Lululemon | 10 | 13.9% |
| Vuori | 6 | 8.3% |
| Nike | 5 | 6.9% |
| Free Fly | 3 | 4.2% |
| Rhone | 3 | 4.2% |
| Patagonia | 2 | 2.8% |
| Cariloha | 2 | 2.8% |

### How ChatGPT Describes TASC

In our testing, ChatGPT consistently associated TASC with:
- **Bamboo fabric technology** - ChatGPT knows TASC uses bamboo-based materials and BamCo fabric
- **Sustainability** - The brand is positioned as eco-conscious
- **Comfort and softness** - Product qualities are well understood
- **New Orleans heritage** - Family-owned brand story is part of the narrative
- **Performance activewear** - Correctly categorized in the athletic apparel space

---

## Amazon Search Visibility

Amazon is where purchase intent converts to sales. When consumers search Amazon directly for athletic apparel, how often does TASC appear in the results?

- **TASC Visibility:** 31%
- **Queries Appearing:** 26 of 85
- **Opportunity:** Room to grow

### TASC vs. Competitors on Amazon

| Brand | Queries | % of Queries |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **TASC Performance** | **26** | **30.6%** |
| Amazon (retailer) | 4 | 4.7% |
| REI | 3 | 3.5% |
| Under Armour | 3 | 3.5% |
| Free Fly | 3 | 3.5% |
| Lululemon | 2 | 2.4% |
| Rhone | 2 | 2.4% |
| Nike | 1 | 1.2% |

**Opportunity:** While TASC leads competitors on Amazon for this query set, 31% visibility means TASC misses two-thirds of potential discovery opportunities. When consumers search Amazon for "bamboo shirts" or "sustainable workout clothes," TASC should appear more consistently.

## Commerce Platforms & Technical SEO

### ChatGPT Instant Checkout

OpenAI launched "Instant Checkout" in September 2025, allowing consumers to purchase products directly within ChatGPT conversations. This is powered by the "Agentic Commerce Protocol."

**TASC is Automatically Eligible:** Because TASC uses Shopify, they are automatically eligible for ChatGPT Instant Checkout with no application required.

| Brand | Platform | ChatGPT Commerce |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **TASC Performance** | Shopify | **Auto-Eligible** |
| Vuori | Shopify | Auto-Eligible |
| Free Fly | Shopify | Auto-Eligible |
| Rhone | Shopify | Auto-Eligible |
| Lululemon | Custom | Must Apply |
| Nike | Custom | Must Apply |
| Under Armour | Custom | Must Apply |

### Amazon Brand Stores

**Important distinction:** An official Amazon Brand Store (requires Brand Registry) features custom hero images, branded design, curated collections, and brand storytelling. A brand filter page is auto-generated by Amazon from product listings with no customization. Products may also appear via third-party resellers without brand control.

| Brand | Official Brand Store | Reseller Presence | Amazon Status |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **TASC Performance** | **NO** | YES | Brand filter page only (no custom storefront) |
| Nike | YES | YES | Official Brand Store (returned 2024-2025) |
| Under Armour | YES | YES | Official Brand Store with outlet section |
| Rhone | YES | YES | Official Brand Store |
| Lululemon | NO | Third-party only | No official presence; third-party reselling restricted |
| Vuori | NO | YES | Products available via resellers (not brand-controlled) |
| Free Fly | NO | YES | Products available via resellers (not brand-controlled) |
| Patagonia | NO | NO | No Amazon presence (DTC and select retailers) |

**Gap Identified:** TASC products are available on Amazon but the brand does not have an official Brand Store with custom branding and curated content. Competitors Nike, Under Armour, and Rhone have invested in official Brand Stores that provide better brand presentation and discoverability.

### Entity Coherence Risk

When products appear on Amazon via resellers without brand control, descriptions often differ from the brand's website. **AI optimization engines demote brands when descriptions are inconsistent across channels.** This "entity incoherence" confuses AI systems about what a brand actually is and does, reducing recommendation likelihood.

Brands with consistent messaging across all channels—website, Amazon, retailers, social—are more likely to be recommended by AI assistants. When TASC's Amazon product descriptions differ from tascperformance.com, or when resellers use outdated copy, AI systems receive conflicting signals.

## Amazon as a Research Channel: The ROPO Effect

Even consumers who prefer to buy in-store often **start their research on Amazon**. Understanding this "Research Online, Purchase Offline" (ROPO) behavior is critical for channel strategy decisions.

### Key Statistics

| Behavior | Statistic | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Product searches starting on Amazon | **50-61%** | Coresight Research 2025 |
| Fashion sales happening in physical stores | **79%** | Shopify Enterprise |
| Consumers who prefer to buy apparel in-store | **58%** | UniformMarket |
| Men's apparel shoppers who webroom | **49%** | ReadyCloud |
| Consumers who research online before any purchase | **88%** | Retail Perceptions |
| In-store sales influenced by online behavior | **56%** | Dinmo Research |
| Consumers who dislike online shopping (can't see items) | **47%** | FitSmallBusiness |

### Strategic Consideration: The Amazon Discovery Gap

Choosing not to sell on Amazon may be a sound channel management decision to protect brand positioning and margins. However, it creates a significant **discovery gap**:

- **50-61% of consumers start product research on Amazon** - TASC products are on Amazon but without an official Brand Store, brand presentation is limited
- **Even ROPO shoppers who prefer to buy in-store** (49% of men's apparel buyers) often begin their research on Amazon
- **Competitors Nike, Under Armour, and Rhone have official Amazon Brand Stores** - they capture research traffic with better brand presentation, even from consumers who may buy elsewhere
- **Premium brands Lululemon and Vuori avoid Amazon entirely** - but they have stronger brand awareness and retail distribution to offset this

### Activewear Category ROPO Behavior

Activewear falls into the category where ROPO behavior is strongest. Consumers want to:

- **Feel the fabric** - bamboo's softness is a key differentiator that's hard to convey online
- **Try on for fit** - athletic apparel sizing varies significantly by brand
- **See colors in person** - screen colors don't always match reality
- **Get immediate gratification** - take the product home same day

**Implication for TASC:** TASC's strong Google and ChatGPT visibility (80% and 79%) is critical because these are primary research channels. However, missing from Amazon means missing consumers who start their journey there. Consider whether an Amazon presence - even limited - could serve as a discovery funnel that drives traffic to tascperformance.com or retail partners.

### llms.txt Files

**Opportunity:** None of the brands analyzed have implemented llms.txt files. This represents a first-mover opportunity for TASC to establish thought leadership and potentially improve AI assistant visibility.

## Strategic Recommendations

### CRITICAL PRIORITY: Fix Bing Search Visibility

TASC's 2% Bing visibility is the most critical gap. Bing powers Microsoft Copilot, Edge, and Windows—reaching over 100 million users daily who currently cannot find TASC.

**Immediate Actions:**
- **Bing Webmaster Tools:** Verify site is properly submitted and indexed
- **IndexNow Protocol:** Implement for real-time indexing updates
- **Bing Places:** Ensure business listing is complete
- **Technical Audit:** Check for crawler blocks or indexing issues
- **Microsoft Advertising:** Consider brand awareness campaigns on Bing

**Expected Outcome:** Increase Bing visibility from 2% to 40%+ to match Google performance.

### HIGH PRIORITY: Improve Amazon Presence

31% Amazon visibility means TASC is missing 7 out of 10 potential discovery opportunities on the world's largest product search engine. Additionally, TASC lacks an official Brand Store while competitors Nike, Under Armour, and Rhone have invested in custom storefronts.

**Actions:**
- **Enroll in Amazon Brand Registry:** Required for Brand Store access and brand protection
- **Create Official Brand Store:** Custom storefront with hero images, brand story, curated collections
- **Optimize product titles:** Include "bamboo," "sustainable," key search terms
- **Enhance bullet points:** Lead with benefits consumers search for
- **A+ Content:** Build out enhanced brand content on all listings
- **Sponsored Products:** Target key category terms

**Expected Outcome:** Increase Amazon visibility from 31% to 50%+ and improve brand presentation for the 50-61% of consumers who start product research on Amazon.

### MAINTAIN: Protect Google & ChatGPT Leadership

TASC's 80% visibility in Google and ChatGPT is exceptional and provides significant competitive advantage. Maintain this leadership position.

**Ongoing Actions:**
- Continue publishing authoritative content about bamboo technology
- Maintain structured data (JSON-LD) on all product pages
- Monitor quarterly for visibility changes
- Ensure brand messaging consistency across all channels

## Success Metrics

| Surface | Current | 6-Month Target | Status |

## Methodology

### Study Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Queries Tested | 90 |
| Geographic Focus | United States |
| Date Conducted | January 27, 2026 |
| Brands Tracked | 21 (TASC + 20 competitors/retailers) |

### Query Categories

Queries were designed to reflect real consumer search behavior in TASC's target market:
- **Brand awareness:** "What is TASC Performance?"
- **Product research:** "Best bamboo athletic shirts"
- **Comparisons:** "TASC vs Lululemon"
- **Purchase intent:** "Where to buy TASC Performance"
- **Sustainability:** "Most sustainable activewear brands"
- **Material-specific:** "Bamboo workout clothes"

### Note on Query Set Design

The query set was designed to reflect TASC's target market: consumers searching for bamboo clothing, sustainable activewear, and comfortable athletic apparel. TASC's high visibility percentages reflect dominance in this niche. In broader "best athletic wear" queries, larger brands would have higher visibility.

### Limitations

- Query set was weighted toward TASC-relevant categories
- Single point-in-time measurement; results may vary
- ChatGPT responses can vary between sessions
- Amazon results affected by personalization and inventory
- Brand detection used simple string matching, which may produce false positives (e.g., "BAM" detected within "bamboo" mentions)

### Brands Tracked

**US-focused competitors:** Lululemon, Vuori, Nike, Under Armour, Free Fly, Cariloha, Rhone, Patagonia, Allbirds, Everlane, Girlfriend Collective

**Retailers:** Amazon, Nordstrom, REI

**Note:** BAM (UK bamboo brand), Boody, and Bamtech were included in tracking but are primarily non-US markets. BAM detection showed high false-positive rates due to string matching with "bamboo" - actual BAM brand mentions were minimal.
