      "success": true,
      "response": "Yes, bamboo fabric generally smells less than synthetic fabrics due to its natural properties.\nOdor Resistance\nBamboo fabric contains \"bamboo kun,\" a bio-agent with strong antimicrobial effects that inhibits bacteria and fungi growth, which are primary causes of fabric odors. Synthetics like polyester often trap moisture and bacteria, leading to quicker odor buildup, while bamboo's breathability and moisture-wicking keep skin drier. Users report bamboo clothes staying fresh for multiple wears, outperforming most synthetics.publicmyth+2\nLimitations\nBamboo's resistance isn't absolute and diminishes over repeated washes or heavy use. Specialized synthetics (e.g., with charcoal treatments) can compete, but standard bamboo excels in natural odor control. For activewear or your running needs, bamboo blends offer a reliable, low-odor option.sivanaspirit+1",
