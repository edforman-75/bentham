CATEGORY VISIBILITY GAPS
------------------------

GENERIC "BEST" QUERIES - CRITICAL WEAKNESS

TASC is rarely mentioned in generic recommendation queries:

    Query                                   TASC Mentioned?   Top Brands
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Best moisture wicking shirts            No                Lululemon, Vuori
    Best workout shirts that don't smell    No                Lululemon
    Best sustainable activewear brands      No                Vuori, Cotopaxi
    Best anti-odor athletic shirts          No                Lululemon
    Best eco-friendly men's activewear      No                Vuori, Cotopaxi
    Best shirts for sweaty golfers          No                Lululemon
    Best athletic shirts for hot weather    No                Lululemon

Finding: In 11 "best" category queries, TASC was mentioned in only 2 (18%). Lululemon and Vuori dominate these high-intent searches.

BAMBOO-SPECIFIC QUERIES - STRENGTH

    Query                                   TASC Mentioned?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Best bamboo athletic clothing brands    Yes
    Best bamboo polo shirts for golf        Yes
    TASC vs Free Fly bamboo shirts          Yes
    Cariloha vs TASC bamboo quality         Yes
    TASC vs BAM bamboo clothing             Yes

Finding: TASC performs well in bamboo-specific queries (5/5 mentioned), but struggles when bamboo is not explicitly mentioned.

SUSTAINABILITY QUERIES - MIXED

    Query                                   TASC Mentioned?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Is TASC Performance sustainable?        Yes
    Is TASC more eco-friendly than Everlane? Yes
    Most sustainable athletic wear brand    No
    Best sustainable activewear brands      No
    Best eco-friendly men's activewear      No

Finding: TASC appears in direct sustainability questions but is absent from general "best sustainable" lists where Vuori and Cotopaxi dominate.


AMAZON SEARCH VISIBILITY
------------------------

Amazon queries returned TASC products in 76/90 searches. Comparison queries (e.g., "vuori vs tasc") do not return product results on Amazon, which is expected.

Of successful product searches, 18 results featured TASC products in the top 3 positions.


RETAIL PARTNER VISIBILITY
-------------------------

Mentions of retail partners across AI responses:

    Retailer              Mentions
    -------------------------------
    REI                       62
    Amazon                    28
    Nordstrom                 28
    Target                    19
    Dick's Sporting Goods      1
    Walmart                    1

Finding: REI is the most frequently mentioned retail partner, suggesting strong brand association with outdoor/performance retailers.


RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

1. CONTENT GAP: GENERIC CATEGORY QUERIES
   TASC is invisible in "best activewear" and "best workout clothes" searches. Create content targeting these high-volume queries. Competitors Lululemon and Vuori currently own this space.

2. STRENGTHEN SUSTAINABILITY NARRATIVE
   Despite bamboo/eco-friendly positioning, TASC is not appearing in sustainability-focused AI recommendations. Vuori and Cotopaxi dominate here. Consider:

   - More prominent sustainability certifications
   - Partnership with eco-focused publications
   - Enhanced sustainability content on tascperformance.com

3. LEVERAGE BAMBOO DIFFERENTIATION
   TASC owns "bamboo athletic wear" in AI responses. Double down on bamboo-specific content and queries to maintain this advantage.

4. COMPETITOR QUERY OPTIMIZATION
   When competitors are listed first in queries ("Lululemon vs TASC"), TASC mention rate drops. Create comparison content with TASC positioned first.

5. CITATION BUILDING
   While tascperformance.com is the top cited source, expanding presence on high-authority review sites (GearJunkie, Men's Health, OutdoorGearLab) would improve visibility in recommendation queries.
